### Home Page

The home page hosts all features of the application. From here you can see all the recipes added to the list, ordered in chronological order from when they were added. All sections of the recipe are listed which are name, what kind of cuisine it is, a picture of the recipe, the ingredients, directions to prepare, as well as a delete button if you want to get rid of a recipe.

### Create Bar

The create bar at the bottom of the page allows the user to add a new recipe to the list with all sections. After pressing the "create" button the new recipe will be added to the bottom of the list.
